          <h4>A little bit of detail</h4>
          <p>
            My [English] name is Don. I'm currently an engineering student at
            <a class="url" href="https://newsroom.ucla.edu/">UCLA</a>, pursuing
            by Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering. I was
            born an American, but I grew up outside of the United States and
            only moved to Greater Los Angeles back in 2022 for college. Outside
            of school, I enjoy writing (on this website), reading, movies,
            poker, and traveling. I love exploring new places—especially trying
            out new food. I also enjoy poker and board games in general, after
            being introduced to them by my friends a few years ago. Regarding
            school, engineering has been fun for me. Lots of ups and downs, and
            certainly a lot of work to be done. That said, the end results are
            often rewarding.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to know more about my curriculum and professional
            experiences, please check out my portfolio and résumé at
            <a href="https://ddonle.com/" class="url">ddonle.com</a>. I'm also
            currently working as a math, physics, and computer science tutor, I
            left some of my personal notes in the <b>Notes</b> section above,
            feel free to use them.
          </p>

          <h4>Is that all you have to say about computer science?</h4>
          <p>Of course not. Here's a bit more to my story:</p>
          <p>
            At the age of 15, I was introduced to computers and programming
            after inheriting my first laptop from my older brother. I wrote my
            first few lines of code in C, starting with a simple script to solve
            quadratic and cubic equations, and then an unsuccessful attempt at
            solving the quartic. Soon after, I built a simple scientific
            calculator, a game of tic-tac-toe, followed by a basic version of
            Snake on the terminal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout my teenage years, I've tried many other programming
            languages (like Python or J*vascript), but it turns out I prefer
            languages that are closer to the hardware, yet high-level enough to
            be productive like C or C++, and most recently, Rust. Overtime, I
            also found myself drawn slightly more to the electrical engineering
            side of computers—which ultimately led to my choice of major in
            college.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have some experiences in various technologies in web development,
            but I prefer to work in fields that involve system and low-level
            programming, which includes: Low-latency C/C++; Computer vision;
            ODEs/PDEs modeling and physics simulation; 2D and 3D Graphics
            Rendering; and General-purpose GPU programming.

          <h3 class="home-h3-headers">About this website</h3>
          <h4>Background and choice of design</h4>
          <p>
            I started digging through the internet back in middle school to
            collect and read scientific textbooks. While doing so, I couldn't
            help but encounter a lot of interesting computer science and math
            blogs. As a result, I got inspired by some of them and decided to
            create this website: a place for me to upload my writings and
            projects. I primarily write about math, programming, and physics,
            and occasionally about everyday topics like
            <a class="url" href="/posts/tested-food-places">food reviews</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This website was formally built back in summer of 2024, but I've
            been writing a lot of the content on this website on LaTeX
            documentations way before that. I coded this website from scratch
            using HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript (ancient and primitive, I
            know, but they works). For this reason, the website might not be
            very well-optimized, so please excuse me. To view the source code,
            click on the logo on the side navigation bar or follow this
            <a
              href="https://github.com/hilbertcube/neumanncondition"
              class="url"
              >link</a
            >.
          </p>
          <ul style="line-height: 1.6">
            <li style="margin: var(--in-page-li-spacing) 0">
              <strong>Question</strong>: Why not use a framework or a static
              site generator?
            </li>
            <li style="margin: var(--in-page-li-spacing) 0">
              <strong>Answer</strong>: I wanted to learn the basics of web
              development, so in order to learn, I must create things. This
              website the became my first web project. Plus, this site has no
              complex API calls, so a framework would be overkill, although
              using a framework would have probably been a bit easier. Ok, but
              why not a static site generator like Jekyll? I feel like static
              site generators offer much less control over things, such as the
              ability to easily create highly customizable components like this
              one:
              <div
                class="theorem"
                data-theorem-name=" (The Hairy Ball Theorem)"
              >
                There is no nonvanishing continuous tangent vector field on
                even-dimensional n-spheres.
              </div>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong>Structure: </strong>
            There are two types of blogs on this website: articles and posts.
            Articles are technical and focus specifically on topics in math,
            computer science, physics, or engineering. Posts, on the other hand,
            are shorter, usually non-technical, and primarily cover everyday
            niche topics.
          </p>

          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>
            Building an entire blog system from scratch is no easy task, but the
            fun part about doing so is me having fine-grained control over
            everything. However, too much control over something can be a real
            headache. This means that if something goes wrong on this website,
            it's entirely my fault.
          </p>
          <div
            style="
              display: flex;
              justify-content: center;
              align-items: center;
              margin: 30px 0;
            "
          >
            <img
              src="mrincredibles.png"
              alt="mr. incredible meme"
              style="width: 100%; max-width: 520px; height: auto"
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            Instead of using pre-built components or a template like any sane
            person would, I decided to write thousands of lines of CSS and
            Javascript and I had to constantly fix the code to ensure that it
            works well on both desktop and mobile. Now that I'm looking back, I
            think that it was a real pain and a waste of time, but here we are.
          </p>
          <p>
            That said, all of it still ties back to one thing: future-proofing
            my work. Whenever I create something, I always think about my future
            self. I constantly ask how I can make things a bit easier down the
            line, like the choice of loading certain components dynamically.
            This choice actually tanked performance, but it did make things
            easier for me whenever I want to add, let's say a new section on the
            top bar. Because of that, I've lost count of how many times I've
            changed the design just to make the process of updating content
            easier.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please don't get me wrong. I DO place a major emphasis on
            efficiency, optimization, and speed. But that's only for my work in
            system programming, or if it's something related to web dev that
            really needs performance, I'd just use a framework like Next. For a
            personal, hobby project like this, I don't really care. The slight
            inefficiency is small enough to be considered negligible, and I'm
            happy with that.
          </p>

          <div
            style="
              display: flex;
              justify-content: center;
              align-items: center;
              margin: 30px 0;
            "
          >
            <img
              src="carl-sagan.png"
              alt="carl sagan apple pie quote"
              style="width: 100%; max-width: 520px; height: auto"
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            Earlier, I did say that I built this website from scratch. I was
            lying. Nobody builds anything from scratch, we're all standing on
            the shoulder of someone. Some other tools I used are
            <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/" class="url">MathJax</a>, a
            javascript library that helps display fancy equation like this:
          </p>
          <div class="equation">
            $$ \rho h\frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial t^2} = - D\nabla^4 w +
            T\nabla^2 w -K_0w -K_1\pd{w}{t} + T_1\nabla^2\pd{w}{t} +
            F(\textbf{x}, t). $$
          </div>
          <!-- <div class="equation">
            $$\hat{f} (\xi)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)e^{-2\pi ix\xi}dx.$$
          </div> -->
          <p>
            On your left side, in the side navigation bar, I used
            <a href="https://github.com/2016rshah/githubchart-api" class="url"
              >ghchart</a
            >
            by
            <a href="https://github.com/2016rshah" class="url">2016rshah</a> to
            display my GitHub activities. I wish he had added an option to
            change the cell colors, as it would've worked better with dark mode.
            Someone even opened a pull request for it, but the author is nowhere
            to be seen. I also use
            <a href="https://prismjs.com/" class="url">prism.js</a> to provide
            some nice code syntax-highlighting for websites like below. You can
            change the code theme in the setting
          </p>

          <div class="box">
            <div class="code-container">

          <h4>Check list</h4>
          <p>
            The general layout of this website should be completed, but I will
            still add some new features every once in a while, if I have time.
            This website is still relatively new anyway.
