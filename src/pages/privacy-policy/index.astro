      <h2 class="h3-visual">Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        I value your privacy and want to be transparent about how data is
        handled when you visit this website. This website does not collect,
        store, or process any personally identifiable information (PII), such as
        your name, email address, phone number, or IP address.

      <h2 class="h3-visual">Use of Google Analytics</h2>
      <p>
        To help me understand how people interact with this website and improve
        the overall experience, I use Google Analytics, a third-party tool that
        collects general usage data. While I don't personally collect or store
        any of your personal information, Google Analytics gathers anonymous
        data through cookies and similar technologies.
      </p>
      <p>Here's what Google Analytics may collect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li style="margin: var(--in-page-li-spacing) 0">
          <strong>Country of access:</strong>
          This tells me the general region (by country) where visitors are coming
          from. It helps me understand where my readers are based and how to better
          serve different audiences.
        </li>
        <li style="margin: var(--in-page-li-spacing) 0">
          <strong>Page title and screen class:</strong>
          This is part of the "Pages and Screens" report, which shows how users engage
          with specific pages or screens. It helps me see which posts are most popular
          and how people move through the site.
        </li>
        <li style="margin: var(--in-page-li-spacing) 0">
          <strong>Traffic acquisition:</strong>
          This report shows how visitors arrive at the blog—whether through search
          engines, social media, direct visits, or other sources. It helps me understand
          which channels are most effective in reaching new readers.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Google Analytics uses cookies to collect data. You can manage or disable
        cookies in your browser settings if you prefer. Just be aware that doing
