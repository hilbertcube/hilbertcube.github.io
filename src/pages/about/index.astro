      <p>
        My [English] name is Don. I'm currently an engineering student at
        <a class="url" href="https://ucla.edu/">UCLA</a>, pursuing by Bachelor
        of Science in Computer Science and Engineering. Outside of school, I
        enjoy writing (on this website), reading, movies, and traveling. I love
        exploring new places, especially trying out new food. I also enjoy
        poker, blackjack and board games in general.
      </p>
      <p>

        experiences, please check out my portfolio and résumé at

        either from my classes or from when I worked as a tutor, feel free to use
        them.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h4-visual">Is that all you have to say about computer science?</h3>
      <p>Of course not. Here's a bit more to my story:</p>
      <p>
        At the age of 15, I was introduced to computers and programming after
        inheriting my first laptop from my older brother. I wrote my first few
        lines of code in C, starting with a simple script to solve quadratic and
        cubic equations, and then an unsuccessful attempt at solving the
        quartic. Soon after, I built a simple scientific calculator, a game of
        tic-tac-toe, followed by a basic version of Snake on the terminal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout my teenage years, I've tried many other programming languages
        (like Python or JavaScript), but it turns out I prefer languages that
        are strongly typed, closer to the hardware, yet high-level enough to be
        productive like C or C++, and most recently, Rust. Overtime, I also
        found myself drawn slightly more to the engineering side of computers
        (i.e. computer architecture, digital systems, signal processing, etc.)
        which ultimately led to my choice of major in college.
      </p>
      <p>
        The majority of my programming experience is in C and C++, primarily
        within the aerospace industry and in the fields of image processing,
        SLAM, GPUs, and computer graphics. While I have worked in web
        development, it is not my main focus. I enjoy programming in general,
        but I am particularly drawn to low-level and systems programming.

        <p>
          I started digging through the internet back in middle school to
          collect and read scientific textbooks. While doing so, I couldn't help
          but encounter a lot of interesting computer science and math blogs. As
          a result, I got inspired by some of them and decided to create this
          website: a place for me to upload my writings and projects. I
          primarily write about math, programming, and physics, and occasionally
          about everyday topics like
          <a class="url" href="/posts/tested-food-places">food reviews</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This website was formally built back in summer of 2024, but I've been
          writing a lot of the content on this website on LaTeX documentations
          way before that. I coded this website from scratch using HTML, CSS,
          and vanilla Javascript (ancient and primitive, I know, but they
          works). For this reason, the website might not be very well-optimized,
          so please excuse me. To view the source code, click on the logo on the
          side navigation bar or follow this
          <a href="https://github.com/hilbertcube/neumanncondition" class="url"

            <strong>Question</strong>: Why not use a framework or a static site
            generator?
          </li>
          <li style="margin: var(--in-page-li-spacing) 0">
            <strong>Answer</strong>: I wanted to learn the basics of web
            development, so in order to learn, I must create things. This
            website the became my first web project. Plus, this site has no
            complex API calls, so a framework would be overkill, although using
            a framework would have probably been a bit easier. Ok, but why not a
            static site generator like Jekyll? I feel like static site
            generators offer much less control over things, such as the ability
            to easily create highly customizable components like this one:
            <div
              class="theorem"
              data-theorem-name=" (F.T. of an Impulse Train)"
            >
              The Fourier transform of the impulse train is another impulse
              train:
              <div class="equation">
                \[ \mathcal&#123;F&#125;\&#123;\delta_T(t)\&#125; =
                \frac&#123;2\pi&#125;&#123;T&#125;\sum_&#123;k=-\infty&#125;^&#123;\infty&#125;
                \delta(\omega - k\omega_s), \qquad \omega_s =
                \frac&#123;2\pi&#125;&#123;T&#125;. \]

          There are two types of blogs on this website: articles and posts.
          Articles are technical and focus specifically on topics in math,
          computer science, physics, or engineering. Posts, on the other hand,
          are shorter, usually non-technical, and primarily cover everyday niche
          topics.

          Earlier, I did say that I built this website from scratch. I was
          lying. Nobody builds anything from scratch, we're all standing on the
          shoulder of someone. Some other tools I used are
          <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/" class="url">MathJax</a>, a
          javascript library that helps display fancy equation like this:
        </p>
        <div class="equation">
          $$ \rho h\frac&#123;\partial^2 w&#125;&#123;\partial t^2&#125; = -
          D\nabla^4 w + T\nabla^2 w -K_0w -K_1\pd&#123;w&#125;&#123;t&#125; +
          T_1\nabla^2\pd&#123;w&#125;&#123;t&#125; + F(\textbf&#123;x&#125;, t).
          $$
        </div>
        <p>
          I also use
          <a href="https://prismjs.com/" class="url">prism.js</a> to provide some
          nice code syntax-highlighting for websites like below. You can change the
          code theme in the setting
        </p>

        <div class="box">
          <div class="code-container">

double numerical_derivative(Func f, double x, double h) &#123;
    // Use the central difference formula for better accuracy
    return (f(x + h) - f(x - h)) / (2.0 * h);
